## TODO:
- Identify and Describe the Problem
- Identify the business, its goals and possible constraints for the solution and the used pipeline
- Weight the 2D vs 3D image processing paradigm and choose which one to use and why

<br/>

- OTHER THINGS IN BETWEEN

<br/>

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis [Class Imbalance, Check type of problem - if we can switch from multi-class to binary classification, maybe perform synthetic sampling or data prunning, If there is a lot of data maybe consider a PCA to reduce processing costs]
- Select Algorithms and the reasons behind the choice
- Split the data based on a K-Fold Cross Validation Stratigy
- Perform Grid Search for parameter tunning on each one of the algorithms
- Train the model with the best hyperparameters found and evaluate the performance based on multiple metrics [balanced accuracy, f1-score, ...]
- Perform a statistical evaluation on the model's performance
- Does it achieve the business goals and at what costs?
- Ethical Considerations and identify possible privacy breaches (even though the data is anonimized)
- YouTube Presentation Video
